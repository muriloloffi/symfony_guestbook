# A Guestbook (made using Symfony)

This is a Guestbook application. More precicely, a backup of the lessons from the book "Symfony 6: The Fast Track" by Symfony founder Fabien Potencier. In this repository I will commit and document the steps taken in the book. 
During the learning process the project will be hosted at Platform.sh, which students of the book are encouraged to, but later the project should be migrated to a different host as Platform.sh is free for a limited time.
